# Media Tracker

A React web app for tracking any form of media — complete with tagging, editing, and persistent local storage.

## 🧩 Overview

Media Tracker lets users:

* Add entries for movies, games, or books.
* Assign and edit tags for flexible categorization.
* Edit or delete items inline.
* Save everything automatically using local storage.

Built with **React**, **HTML**, and **CSS** — this was my first React project and a step up from my previous web projects.

## 💡 Features

* Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) support.
* Tag system with pill-style UI.
* Persistent data using a custom `useLocalStorage` hook.
* Responsive, clean design built with React hooks.
